      "**Just intonation (JI)** today falls under the umbrella of microtonal music, because it involves playing \"between the notes\" of the 12-tone scale we're used to. As I type microtonal, my spellchecker decorates it with a sad squiggle, confirming I've drifted (again) into a topic that's not even in its dictionary. But JI is often described as _the way music should naturally sound_. So which one is it, an obscure deviation from the norm, or an ideal we should return to?\n",

      "In order to understand JI, first you have to \"empty your cup\". Most people's cup is occupied by **12-tone equal temperament (12TET)**, which defines the notes we're typically allowed to play. To understand 12TET, start with the octave: going up or down one octave means multiplying or dividing the frequency by 2. Then, divide this octave into 12 equally spaced semitones. This \"space between semitones\" is actually a specific irrational number: ùíî¬†\\=212\\=\\\\sqrt\\[12\\]{2}. Multiplying by this number 12 times is equivalent to a single multiplication by 2 (the octave):\n",
      "\n",
      "12-tone equal temperament. Circles contain approximate frequencies in Hertz.  \n",
      "_ùíî_¬†\\=212‚âà1.0595...\\=\\\\sqrt\\[12\\]{2} \\\\approx 1.0595...\n",
      "\n",
      "Just intonation is a broader system which does not equally divide the octave in any way. In JI, you take your reference pitch, then multiply or divide its frequency by any whole number to get playable tones as desired. In other words, all intervals in JI are natural ratios, while in 12TET, this is only the case for the octave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example of JI intervals. Circles contain approximate frequencies in Hertz.\n",
      "\n",
      "In psychoacoustics, it's generally accepted that our perception of harmony relies on the interpretation of intervals as natural ratios. Simplifying a bit, this means JI is an exact representation of the way we perceive harmony, while 12TET gets harmonic significance from the fact that **it contains intervals that are good approximations of JI intervals**:\n",
      "\n",
      "A simple melody in both JI and 12TET.\n",
      "\n",
      "The theory, so far, tells us that JI should be more consonant than 12TET, but the above examples don't show this convincingly. This is where \"writing an album\" comes in. To me, making music is the goal of researching it, but it also guides and informs the research, giving a means to judge subjectively whether the results are useful. Below, we'll get to deeper theory, with examples of things that worked noticeably better in JI, but also things that fundamentally don't work in JI.\n",
      "\n",
      "But before composing in JI, it's necessary to have tools that allow it, and this is more challenging than it might seem. Even simple JI intervals inside a single octave can actually result in an infinity of possible tones, so it seems like we should somehow narrow down the possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Boring\" Solution: Scales\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Music-making tools, both digital and physical, often assume you want to work with a limited set of predefined tones. This clashes with \"raw\" JI and its infinite level of detail. The most common solution, both ancient and modern, is to use a subset of JI with 12 tones per octave. Assuming a modern mindset, this effectively turns JI into an alternative tuning for a familiar musical system.\n",

      "Example of a 12-tone tuning based on JI: the Pythagorean tuning.  \n",
      "Circles contain approximate frequencies in Hertz.\n",
      "\n",
      "I won't dwell too long on the creation of just-intoned, general-purpose scales, but it's important to understand that this approach is central to the history of music[1](https://www.osar.fr/notes/justintonation#fn:1). There are still some situations where it might make sense to use such scales, but I'll venture to say that in the common case, it's not a great idea. The results easily end up more dissonant than 12TET when the wrong intervals are played, and it's surprisingly hard to avoid the \"wrong intervals\", something I'll detail further down.\n",
      "\n",
      "A more creative approach is to experiment with alternative sets of tones that don't attempt to mimic 12TET. These might not have a fixed number of tones per octave, and are often laid out with more consonant tones closer together, which takes some of the edge off the problem mentioned above. These alternative layouts are especially useful to bring physical instruments closer to just intonation.\n",

      "The Far-Out Solution: Freestyle JI\n",
      "----------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, we've bent to the common view that JI can't be used directly, and that you need to narrow it down to a chosen scale or tuning. But what if we don't want to use a predefined set of tones at all? This is what I've been calling \"raw\" JI, and it's actually an existing approach called freestyle JI, which means you have to be ready to give each note its individual frequency, with all frequencies being natural ratios of each other. This also has the reputation of being terribly impractical, which is always a selling point for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's see how freestyle JI can make an interesting composition. Imagine the composition moves through a few chords. In a system of fixed tones, you would look at your context (the current chord, maybe the overall key, etc.) and pick the best-matching tones from your predefined set. My approach to freestyle JI was to **redefine which tones are available** whenever the context changes, or in fact, at arbitrary moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of two successive chords which have their \"bespoke\" tones defined individually:\n",
      "\n",
      "In the example above, you can compare the same chords in JI and in their closest possible 12TET approximation[2](https://www.osar.fr/notes/justintonation#fn:2). I'll just say that our habituation to 12TET makes things difficult to judge, but to me, a listening test reveals two things that work better in JI: first, \"chord 2\" is noticeably more consonant and understandable in JI. This is partly because it contains more [7-limit](https://en.xen.wiki/w/7-limit) intervals, which are more difficult to reproduce in 12TET. Second, the transition between the two chords flows better in JI than in 12TET. I attribute this to keeping shared tones equal, but constructing other tones directly from the shared ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "This brings us to the variety of tones _between_ chords, which becomes more obvious when composing. Throwing all the tones into a single tuning or scale would hardly make sense, with tiny sub-semitone intervals like the one between `9/5` in the first chord and `15/8` in the second. More awkward, arbitrary intervals would appear as more chords are added.\n",
      "\n",
      "By avoiding any global scale or tuning, tones between chords are allowed to become unrelated, and tend to become even more unrelated between non-adjacent chords. This is exactly what happens throughout the album in question: the harmony is consonant and continuous, but if you take a global view, the album actually contains over 40 distinct tones in a single octave. Could I have built a 40-tone scale and used it to compose the whole thing? Not really: there would be no way to predict which ones are required in advance!\n",
      "\n",
      "Building Chords and Composing in Freestyle JI\n",
      "---------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not a guide on composing in JI, the objective is more to understand the value of JI and to see where it fits. That said, it would be rich to write all this without even giving a hint of the _how_. Since the examples focus on complex chords, you might ask right away: how do you build these chords?\n",
      "\n",
      "Chords and transient scales in JI can be built using variants of James Tenney's harmonic crystal growth technique[3](https://www.osar.fr/notes/justintonation#fn:3). It sounds fancy, but it's a natural process: you take a small number of \"seed\" tones (in the examples above and below, 2 seed tones were used for each chord), and you \"grow\" the set by finding tones that are most consonant with all the starting points. In this context, Tenney gives a precise definition of consonance in the form of [harmonic distance](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Tenney_height), but different definitions can and should be experimented with. Tenney also describes this process as iterative, where each addition uses the entire previous set as reference, but I prefer to measure distance from nothing but the seeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "This method can produce a huge variety of chords, especially when slightly modified or constrained in different ways. The relationship between the seeds is perhaps the main determinant for the \"feel\" of the final chord.\n",
      "\n",
      "The example above is representative of crystal growth, and shows another interesting aspect of this technique: it gives you a direct measure of which tones are central to the chord, and which ones are more peripheral. This can be exploited in composition: do you start with misleading tones, only to reveal the true nature of the chord later on? Or do need to make an impact and state the chord's root immediately? The \"order of growth\" makes it easy to find this balance, something which is used in this example.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you think this approach seems impractical to do \"by hand\", you're completely right. The broader question of which tools suit freestyle JI is a tough one. In my case, I somewhat sidestepped this issue by writing everything in code, for which there's currently no better documentation than [the source code itself](https://github.com/pac-dev/AmbientGardenAlbum). That said, nothing in this post is specific to algorithmic music, and I believe that programming should not be necessary to compose in freestyle JI.\n",
      "\n",
      "The topic of tools, and of deeper practical music theory for composing in this system, is something I would love to dive into, but that's firmly for another day (or lifetime, but we'll get there!) What's really missing here is the counterbalance: I've praised the light side of JI, so all that's left now is to **complain about the dark side**.\n",

      "It's sometimes said that 12TET, or even temperaments in general, are mostly \"vestigial\" when composing digitally. After all, computers shouldn't be limited to a fixed number of keys, holes or frets like physical instruments. So in theory, one can imagine that JI offers strictly more freedom and consonance than 12TET. This is, of course, quite wrong, and in a way that has nothing to do with ease-of-use or tools.\n",

      "Values inside the cells are relative to some base frequency, in this case, 440Hz.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be precise, this is a piece of the infinite _5-limit pitch class lattice_ (a variant of the [tonnetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonnetz)). Our reference pitch is in the middle. Moving right is equivalent to multiplying the current frequency by 3. Similarly, moving up is a multiplication by 5. All of the results are automatically transposed into a single octave. While more dimensions could be added, this choice of factors is good at representing \"mainstream\" harmony, and at placing more consonant tones closer together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's zoom out a bit to reveal the most important pattern on the lattice:\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar tones in just intonation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Playing on the lattice reveals an inevitable fact: some tones are very similar to each other. Clicking on a tone above highlights the most similar tones. These small intervals are _commas_, and they make composition in JI difficult, because we don't hear the harmonic relationship that defines them, instead, they appear to us as out-of tune versions of the same tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things get interesting when we represent tempered systems on the lattice. I mentioned that 12TET gets its harmonic significance from the way it approximates JI intervals. This can be heard and visualized by comparing the JI lattice against its corresponding 12TET approximation:\n",

      "Exactly equal tones in 12TET.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 12TET lattice, those similar tones are now exactly equal, in other words, the commas are tempered. In fact, the 12 tones of 12TET are now repeated infinitely across the grid. **This is a tiling**, which opens up different possibilities for composition: you can harmoniously move in any direction, and magically end up back at your starting point. Let's look at this exact technique being used in the _An√≠ron_ chord progression from Howard Shore's soundtrack to The Lord of the Rings. Here, the chords are projected onto the 12TET lattice:\n",

      "\n",
      "*   Keep moving in one direction, and become out of tune with your starting point. The result is somewhere between _unsatisfying_ and _jarring_ (\"Solution 1\" above).\n",
      "    \n",
      "*   Jump back to your starting point when you get near a tone that's roughly similar. This introduces an out-of-tune transition and defeats the consonance of JI (\"Solution 2\" above).\n",
      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "12TET naturally merges these small out-of-tune intervals, while distributing any required dissonance evenly over multiple tones. This property exists in other temperaments as well, but 12TET happens to be very good at it. This harmonic technique of \"traveling through\" 12TET's tiling is neither rare not advanced, it's something that musicians and composers do constantly without even thinking about it. Not only that, but it's common to use single chords that connect tiles together, which would also be impossible in JI. That's why a good part of the music that we know and love does not have any equivalent in JI.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more you compose in JI, the more you realize the extent of this problem. Even in some very simple chord progressions, our perception of harmony relies on multiple ambiguous connections between tones in different harmonic directions. JI creates perfect intervals for a single interpretation of how tones are connected, but we still hear the other possible interpretations, and they're now more dissonant than with 12TET!\n",
      "\n",
      "As a consequence, composing in JI is a bit like navigating a minefield. Hidden dissonant intervals are everywhere, and if you don't deliberately avoid them, you're almost guaranteed to simply make things worse than with 12TET. Once you've got a solid intuition for this, then yes, composing in JI can become harmonically rich and varied while remaining consonant.\n",

I'll cap off this shameless \"thesis/antithesis/synthesis\" structure by saying that tuning systems are like artistic construction tools: they all do different things, and while 12TET is great, it's a bit like a hammer that's currently being used for _everything_.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's also a finer point that underlies this entire article: just intonation is often used as an alternative tuning, but it's more interesting to see it as an entirely different way of composing. Most pieces written in 12TET do not convert well to JI. Similarly, you can do things in JI that don't map well to 12TET. This article gives examples of both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Music software often offers a \"tuning\" setting, and then lets you compose using the same old interface. This is interesting to play with, but it's not a good representation of the possibilities of JI, which really call for different ways of representing and reasoning about harmony.\n",

      "\n",
      "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.\n",

      "## 1 Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [12] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [29, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [31, 21, 13].\n",
      "\n",
      "‚àóEqual contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started the effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and has been crucially involved in every aspect of this work. Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention and the parameter-free position representation and became the other person involved in nearly every detail. Niki designed, implemented, tuned and evaluated countless model variants in our original codebase and tensor2tensor. Llion also experimented with novel model variants, was responsible for our initial codebase, and efficient inference and visualizations. Lukasz and Aidan spent countless long days designing various parts of and implementing tensor2tensor, replacing our earlier codebase, greatly improving results and massively accelerating our research.\n",

      "Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht‚àí1 and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional computation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n",

      "## 2 Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n",
      "[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [11]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\n",
      "\n",
      "End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28].\n",
      "\n",
      "To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3 Model Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1*, ..., x*n) to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z1*, ..., z*n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1*, ..., y*m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n",
      "[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.1 Encoder And Decoder Stacks\n",
      "\n",
      "Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\n",
      "\n",
      "![figures/2_image_0.png](figures/2_image_0.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.2 Attention\n",
      "\n",
      "An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n",
      "\n",
      "We call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\n",

      "query with all keys, divide each by ‚àödk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\\mathrm{softmax}(\\frac{Q K^{T}}{\\sqrt{d_{k}}})V$$\n",
      "$$(1)$$\n",
      "\n",
      "The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of ‚àö\n",
      "1 dk\n",
      ". Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n",
      "\n",
      "While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by ‚àö\n",

      "## 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2. Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n",

      "\n",
      "## 3.2.3 Applications Of Attention In Our Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n",
      "- In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n",
      "[31, 2, 8].\n",
      "\n",
      "- The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to ‚àí‚àû) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.3 Position-Wise Feed-Forward Networks\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\mathrm{FFN}(x)=\\operatorname*{max}(0,x W_{1}+b_{1})W_{2}+b_{2}$$\n",
      "FFN(x) = max(0*, xW*1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\n",
      "While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality df f = 2048.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.4 Embeddings And Softmax\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by ‚àödmodel.\n",

      "## 3.5 Positional Encoding\n",

      "## 4 Why Self-Attention\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n",
      "(x1*, ..., x*n) to another sequence of equal length (z1*, ..., z*n), with xi, zi ‚àà R\n",
      "d, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n",
      "\n",
      "One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n",
      "\n",
      "As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n",
      "\n",
      "A single convolutional layer with kernel width *k < n* does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [15], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O(k ¬∑ n ¬∑ d + n ¬∑ d 2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\n",
      "\n",
      "As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\n",

      "## 7 Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n",
